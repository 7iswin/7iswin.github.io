## Projects
### Clinic @ Our Lady of Fatima Quezon City 
[Project Link](https://universityclinicqc.com/account/?next=/)

We seek to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical decision-making
processes, forecasting the overall management of healthcare data and improving patient
outcomes. The proposed web-based clinical system can improve healthcare data
management by utilizing machine learning and EHRs, which will help the university clinic.
By implementing the system, that can forecast the health records of college students,
identifying those at higher risk of clinical admissions within a certain period after dis-
charge. This proactive approach allows for early intervention, personalized care, and
targeted preventive measures, ultimately leading to improved student health outcomes,
reduced healthcare costs, and increased efficiency in healthcare delivery within the uni-
versity campus.

### Using The Artificial Intellegence(AI) and Machine Learning(ML)

Embarking on a journey into the realms of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, my portfolio reflects a dedicated exploration of cutting-edge technologies, with Python as the cornerstone of innovation. Throughout this endeavor, I have delved into diverse projects, leveraging the capabilities of AI and ML to solve real-world challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible.

From predictive modeling to natural language processing, my proficiency in Python has been the driving force behind the development of robust, scalable, and intelligent solutions. Through meticulous coding and a data-driven approach, I've crafted algorithms that not only comprehend complex patterns but also deliver actionable insights.
